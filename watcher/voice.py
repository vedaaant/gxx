"""Speak text aloud via our ElevenLabs voice (proxied through the relay).

Replaces Hermes' native TTS: both the MCP `speak` tool and the proactive gate call
``speak()`` here, so all spoken output uses our ElevenLabs voice while the API key
stays on the relay. The text is PII-scrubbed before it leaves the device (again in
RelayClient.tts, and once more server-side at the relay).

Playback and the relay client are injectable so this unit-tests without audio
hardware or a network.
